  <p>Never understood why so many KISS fans hated this song. As a KISS fan, I thought they did a decent job. They took the trend at the time - disco- and put their spin on it. It's not the typical flamboyant, pansy sounding mash that was common in the disco-era. It's aggressive, driven and has a good hook. Almost every rock band in the 70's succumbed to doing at least one disco song. KISS is one of the VERY few bands that did it their way and made it sound good.</p>
